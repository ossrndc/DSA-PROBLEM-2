## Best of Two

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a regular six faced dice  3  times.  
The score of a player is the sum of the values of the highest  2  rolls. The player with the highest score wins, and the game ends in a Tie if both players have the same score.

Find the winner of the game or determine whether it is a tie.

### Input Format

-   The first line of input will contain a single integer  𝑇T, denoting the number of test cases.
-   Each test case contains six space-separated integers  𝐴1​,  𝐴2​,  𝐴3​,  𝐵1​,  𝐵2  and  𝐵3​  — the values Alice gets in her  3  dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his  3  dice rolls.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line  `Alice`  if Alice wins,  `Bob`  if Bob wins and  `Tie`  in case of a tie.

Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings  `tie`,  `TIE`,  `Tie`, and  `tIe`  are considered identical.

### Constraints

-   1≤𝑇≤10^4
-   1≤𝐴1,𝐴2,𝐴3,𝐵1,𝐵2,𝐵3≤6

### Sample 1:

**Input**

    3
    3 2 5 6 1 1
    4 4 5 6 4 1
    6 6 6 6 6 1

**Output**

    Alice
    Bob
    Tie



### Explanation:

**Test Case  1:**  Alice's score is  8=(3+5)  which is greater than Bob's score  7=(6+1).

**Test Case  2:**  Alice's score is  9=(5+4)  which is less than Bob's score  10=(6+4).

**Test Case  3:**  Alice's score is  12=(6+6)  which is same as Bob's score  12=(6+6).

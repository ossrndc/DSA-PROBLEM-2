## Chocolate Distribution

Christmas is the season of giving. As a part of celebrating the New Year, you decided to give away chocolates to the poor children in your neighbourhood.  
Some of them even asked for  2  chocolates and being the kind soul that you are, you always gave them if you could. They never asked for more than  2  though because they are not greedy.

Now, you have forgotten exactly how many children you gave chocolates to. However, you remember that you started with  𝑁  chocolates and distributed all of them by the end.  
Find the  **minimum**  and  **maximum**  number of possible children that you gave chocolates to.

### Input Format

-   The first line of input will contain a single integer  𝑇, denoting the number of test cases.
-   Each test case consists of one integer  𝑁, the number of chocolates you started with.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, two space-separated integers, the minimum possible number of children and the maximum possible number (in this order).

### Constraints

-   1≤𝑇≤1000
-   1≤𝑁≤1000

### Sample 1:

**Input**

    4
    
    1
    2
    7
    8

**Output**

    1 1
    1 2
    4 7
    4 8



### Explanation:

**Test case  1:**  You had only  1  chocolate, so that must have been given to only  1  child.

**Test case  22:**  You had  2  chocolates, so either you could have given both chocolates to  1  child only, or  1  chocolate each to  2  children.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void
chocolatedis ()
{
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  if (N >= 1 && N <= 1000)
	{
	  if (N % 2 == 0)
		{
		  cout << N / 2 << " " << N;
		}
	  else
		{
		  cout << (N / 2) + 1 << " " << N;
		}
	}
}

int main ()
{
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  if (t >= 1 && t <= 1000)
	{
	  for (int i = 1; i <= t; i++)
		{
		  chocolatedis ();
		}
	}
}
